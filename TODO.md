TODO: 

- Quantify the previous strategy as reach etc;
    - use the components across the 4 original posts and compare the campaign's out-degree, centrality of the First Four users, betweenness, etc.
- Get the data required from the prior campaign:
    - Probability of reposting, liking etc. as characterised by their averages. Estimate
        - Divide #of likes per post / # of followers of the posting user  
        - Rinse and repeat for the comments, reposts etc.  
    - Most influential/hub/super-spreader users to seed 
    - For donations, look at the centrality/betweenness etc. of the corresponding users 


Assumptions: 
    - This is not a temporal network i.e. the followers list is assumed to stay constant throughout.

TODO: (Graphs)

- Maybe we need to plot the time the users prefer to share (one plot for each day) (DONE)
- Maybe we can also plot the number of clicks (Too much maybe)


TODO: 

- Seeding strategies compare effectiveness with cost.
- We can try even personalisation in our campaign --> but we don't have the data (I think so, I'm not sure!)
